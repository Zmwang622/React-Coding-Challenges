## Specifications
Write a component that renders five stacked identical images of ladder pieces. When the user hovers over a piece of the ladder, that ladder piece (as well as all the pieces below it) should expand to a larger size. The starting position of the component (when the userâ€™s mouse is not over any of the images), should look like this. The component should return to this state when the user is not hovering over any images. The image can be found at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jusshe/coding-challenge-pictures/main/ladder.png`.
